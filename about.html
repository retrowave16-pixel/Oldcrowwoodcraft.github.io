          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Born and raised in the tiny rural town of Rathbun, Iowa, Joe has always been around woodworking.  His dad and grandpa were always building something, from little doll beds to complete houses.  Throughout his school career, college, and marriage, woodworking and building things has always been a passion.</p>
          <p>For around 25 years, he's made furniture, turned wooden bowls and cups, built kitchen cabinets and countertops, installed custom wood flooring, and been all around construction.  Lately, the desire to move to full-time woodworking has become a new personal goal.  A husband of 16 years (and counting) and father to 6 wonderful kids, Joe has realized the importance of showing his children that it's possible to turn a passion into a livelihood.</p>
